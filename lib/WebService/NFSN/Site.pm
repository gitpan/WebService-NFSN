=head1 NAME

WebService::NFSN::Site - Access NFSN site API

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 1.00 of
WebService::NFSN::Site, released November 20, 2011
as part of WebService-NFSN version 1.01.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use WebService::NFSN;

    my $nfsn = WebService::NFSN->new($USER, $API_KEY);
    my $site = $nfsn->site($SHORT_NAME);
    $site->addAlias(alias => 'www.example.com');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

WebService::NFSN::Site provides access to NearlyFreeSpeech.NET's
site API.  It is only useful to people who have websites hosted at
NearlyFreeSpeech.NET.

=head1 INTERFACE

=over

=item C<< $site = $nfsn->site($SHORT_NAME) >>

C<$SHORT_NAME>.  Equivalent to

=back

=head2 Properties

None.

=head2 Methods

=over

=item C<< $site->addAlias(alias => $ALIAS) >>

This adds an alias (such as "www.example.com") to an existing web
site. In addition to the site, you must have permission to access the
domain containing the alias. If the domain is not referenced on our
system, it will be added automatically.

If the domain exists and has DNS managed by NFSN, the necessary
resource records will be created automatically.

=item C<< $site->removeAlias(alias => $ALIAS) >>

Removes an alias from a site.  C<$ALIAS> must be an existing alias for
the site.
